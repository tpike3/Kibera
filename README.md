# Kianda Emerging: Modelling Complex Systems to Support Public Policy

**Overview:** 
This is an Agent Based Model using Python 3.6 and Mesa 0.8.3. It replicates daily survival patterns of a synthetically reconstructed population of the Kianda neighborhood in the Kibera Slum of Nairobi Kenya. 


**To Run:**   
1. (recommended) set up a new environment
2. Clone or download
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. execute run.py module

run.py will run the model. 

  	The current parameters are:

  	Duration: 2016 simulated hours (84 days) 

  	Probability for Finding Work: 0.5

  	Pay Multiplier: 25

**Results and Analysis:**
The Jupyter Notebook "Holistic - Results Analysis" is the code used to analyze the results. The results exceed the size limit authorized by GitHub. The results can be recreated by running the model under the desired parameters or requested form the author at tpike3@gmu.edu.

**Population Data:**
The shp file used to create the synthetic population is not available due due to restricted distribution content. Anyone interested in obtaining the original data should contact Dr. Stefano Marras at marras.stefano@gmail.com.

A detailed description of the process used to create the synthetic population is available in the population folder, title *Supplement to Kianda Emerging*
