# Kianda Emerging: Modelling Complex Systems to Support Public Policy

**Overview:** 
This is an Agent Based Model using Python 3.6 and Mesa 0.8.3. It replicates daily survival patterns of a synthetically reconstructed population of the Kianda neighborhood in the Kibera Slum of Nairobi Kenya. 


**To Run:** run.py will run the model. 

  	The current parameters are:

  	Duration: 2016 simulated hours (80 days) 

  	Probability for Finding Work: 0.5

  	Pay Multiplier: 25

**Results and Analysis:**
The Jupyter Notebook "Holistics - Results Analysis" is the code used to analyze the results. The results exceed the size limit authorized by github and so must be recreated by running the model. 

**Population Data:**
The shp file used to create the synthetic population is not available due due to restrcited distribution content. Anyone interested in obtaining the original data should contact Dr. Stefana Marras at marras.stefano@gmail.com.

A detailed description of the process used to create the synthetic population is available in in the population folder, title **Supplment to Kianda Emerging**
